# PyXOpto-modeling-SFDI

This project contains a script for Monte Carlo modeling of light propagation in uniform media using PyXOpto library as well as regression algorithms for inverse problem solving of finding absorption and scattering coefficients of  tissue from diffuse reflectance at different spatial frequencies. For this purpose k-nearest neighbors algorithm and fully connected neural network were used.
