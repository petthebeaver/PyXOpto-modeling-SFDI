# PyXOpto-modeling-SFDI

This project contains a script for Monte Carlo modeling of light propagation in uniform media using [PyXOpto](https://github.com/xopto/pyxopto) library as well as regression algorithms for inverse problem solving of finding absorption and scattering coefficients of  tissue from diffuse reflectance at different spatial frequencies. For this purpose k-nearest neighbors algorithm and fully connected neural network were used. 

## Typical dependence of diffuse reflectance on spatial frequency with different absorption coefficients
